## Runtime Permissions
- The application requires administrator privileges to:
  - Access network interfaces in promiscuous mode
  - Perform ARP scanning on the network
  - Capture packets not destined for the host machine

## Troubleshooting
- If "Access Denied" errors occur, ensure the application is run as Administrator
- If no interfaces are detected, verify Npcap/WinPcap installation
- Windows Defender or other security software may block packet capture functions

## Performance Considerations
- Console output mode may slow down capture rate for high-traffic networks
- ARP scanning on large networks may take several minutes to complete
- File writing performance depends on disk I/O speed
